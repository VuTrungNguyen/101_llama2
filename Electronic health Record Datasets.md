# Overview of Clinical Tasks
Five clinical NLP tasks including:
1. Clinical concept extraction (or named entity recognition [NER])
2. Medical relation extraction (MRE)
3. Semantic textual similarity (STS):
- Determine the extent to which two sentences are similar in terms of semantic meaning
- dataset: N2C2 [^3], restricted access through [Havard portal](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/)
4. Natural language inference (NLI)
- dataset: MedNLI [^4]
> This is a restricted-access resource. To access the files, you must fulfill all of the following requirements:
> - be a [credentialed user](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/)
> - complete required training: [CITI Data or Specimens Only Research](https://physionet.org/settings/training/)
> - You may submit your training [here](https://physionet.org/content/mednli/view-required-training/1.0.0/#1).
> - sign the [data use agreement](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mednli/1.0.0/) for the project

5. Medical question answering (MQA).
- dataset: emrQA medication, emrQA relation [^5]
> - the dataset can be generated by using this [instruction](https://github.com/panushri25/emrQA), or
> - access the dataset through [Havard portal](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/) (you'll need to sign the agreement and request for the data, it comes through the same day)
